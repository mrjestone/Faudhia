## Overview

GiveHope is a charity platform that connects donors with impactful community-driven
campaigns, aiming to make giving easier and more transparent.

## Problem to Solution:

Many users hesitate to donate due to trust issues and a lack of clarity. I designed a userfriendly interface that highlights campaign transparency, donor impact, and easy navigation
to build user confidence.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: It was used as the main design tool

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was balancing emotional appeal with functionality. I learned how to
use storytelling in UI design to encourage action while maintaining a clean, intuitive layout.

## Outcome

The project resulted in an engaging and responsive platform that encourages more user
participation and donation conversions.
