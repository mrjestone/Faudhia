## Overview

KaziConnect is a modern job portal designed to help Tanzanian youth discover career
opportunities, access job listings, build CVs, and receive mentorship. The platform provides a
clean, user-friendly interface for job seekers to find relevant opportunities easily and build
professional resumes.

## Problem to Solution: 

Many Tanzanian youth face challenges accessing reliable job listings, building professional
CVs, and receiving career guidance from one place. Most platforms are either hard to
navigate or offer limited services. KaziConnect solves this by combining job listings, a CV
builder, career tips, and mentorship in one user-friendly platform. The design focuses on
simplicity and accessibility to make job searching easier. This approach empowers users to
take control of their career journey confidently.

## Technologies Used

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was organizing large sets of information (jobs, filters, CV builder, career
tips) in a way that remains intuitive and uncluttered. I learned how to improve information
hierarchy and usability using layout grids, consistent spacing, and clear CTAs. Designing for
local relevance (Tanzania) also pushed me to consider accessibility and simplicity.

## Outcome

A clean, responsive design that enhances the job search experience. Users can search for
jobs by filters, create CVs directly on the platform, and access helpful career resources. The
design supports both desktop and mobile devices with a consistent, professional look.
