## Overview

This is a creative portfolio website for Pope Studio, showcasing services like graphic design,
animation, video production, and audio production with a clean and modern layout.

## Problem to Solution:

The challenge was to organize a wide range of creative services and projects into a clear,
engaging interface. I solved this by using minimal design, easy navigation, and visual
storytelling to guide users smoothly.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: Main design tool

## Challenges and Learnings

Managing multiple service categories while keeping the interface intuitive taught me the
importance of hierarchy and visual balance in portfolio design.

## Outcome

The result is a responsive, user-centered portfolio that effectively presents the studioâ€™s
creative capabilities and attracts potential clients.
